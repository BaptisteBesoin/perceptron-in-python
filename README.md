# About
This is a personnal project that I will use to discover and experiment with my very first AI using a Perceptron. The data that I will provide to the algorithm comes from my other projet "web-scraping" which allowed me to create a database of 2000 appartments and their characteristics. Since it will be the first time that I manipulate an AI I won't be using already existing algorithms from libraries (Scikit, TensorFlow, PyTorch and more...) 
Writing on my own the algorithm will help me have a better understanding of the underlying concepts. I am not trying to create be the perfect nor most efficient algorithm.

# Result
Taking inspirations of existing Perceptron algorithm online (mostly for binary classification). I had to bring modifications to the latter because most algorithm used an activation function (i.e the result was either 0 or 1).  

# Observations and conclusion
The final predictions once the model was trained weren't accurate. In my opinion, it is due to the fact that I don't have enough training data and/or this data is not accurate enough.
Finally, I concluded that the algorithm is not the problem but the data is (although it could be my algorithm's fault), therefore, I think that the hardest part in creating accurate artifical intelligence is to use diverse and large datasets.
