# About
This is a personnal project that I will use to discover and experiment with my very first AI using a Perceptron. The data that I will provide to the algorithm comes from my other projet "web-scraping" which allowed me to create a database of 2000 appartments and their characteristics. Since it will be the first time that I manipulate an AI I won't be using already existing algorithms from libraries (Scikit, TensorFlow, PyTorch and more...) 
Writing on my own the algorithm will help me have a better understanding of the underlying concepts. I am not trying to create be the perfect nor most efficient algorithm.
